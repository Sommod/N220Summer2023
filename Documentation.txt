This assignment didn't pose any problems in terms of the assignment and learning of the code.
The issue I did have was the improper placing of the Script tag. While I usually have it in
the header, the elements of the HTML haven't loaded yet and cause an error. I wanted to keep
the script in the header, so I added the 'defer' tag to wait until after the page is loaded.
That solved my issue with the second task. I added some extra features (like in task 2) which
would be a button to re-color the divs to show they are all randomly picked.
