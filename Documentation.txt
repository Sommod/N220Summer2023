This assignment in general was balanced in both quickly and time consuming. The biggest problem
I had was getting the previously drawn shapes to disappear; I had not known that simply recalling
the 'background' method would 'remove' the previously drawn shapes. The rest of the code was easy
enough to get to draw the shapes and to alter their location of using loops. To ensure that the array
stays small and not continuously grow, I added remove methods to shift each array. Once the removing
shapes was completed, the rest of the assignment came together. As usual, I had to edit the links
after completing the assignment as they were linked to the previous module.
