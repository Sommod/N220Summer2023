I was unsure as to what I wanted to do for my final project; so I ended up altering one of my previous
modules by adding a few more in-depth and interactive actions. In this case, I decided to go back and
use the animation of circles for this project. I keep most of the information from the module, but added
the ability to change the color manually or automatic, the speed of the animation, speed of color changing,
and the amount of circles are drawn. I updated the location of the circles from the previous, which looked
like lines of circles traveling in a circle, to an actual set of cirlces traveling in a circle. Some issues
I had were getting the KeyCodes for the Keyboard. A simple search on P5js's website provided both the numerical
code and ASCII code. The other other problem I had was getting the correct color for randomizing to work. The
issue was I was double setting the value. When setting the color originally, it was done through the constructor
calling the getRandomColor() method. The issue was the double setting; I had set the COLOR variable the METHOD
rather than setting it to a return value. Once I figured out the issue via the console stating it was VOID, I
simply removed the setting and called the method, having the color set inside the method instead. The last big
problem I had was the creation of new circles. I had the correct synax and whatnot, I did however have the wrong
formula for handling the 'size' of the path the circle is to follow. I found out that the 'radius' was too big
and being multipled bigger than it should have been. Next I used modulus, which made the circle radius too small.
I finally figured out I needed to divide the length of the array by 4, and multiple that by default radius to
get the correct radius of the circle path. Finally, a bug that was found, but one I kept into the program as it
added some interesting effect was the speed of the Circles. Originally, the speed was to determine only the speed
in which the circles traveled; However if the value is negative, it reveres the direction of the circles while still
handling the speed correctly. This is due to the fact that the speed is lightly tied to the variable that is also
used for direction, thus the speed also affects direction based on numerical postive or negative.
