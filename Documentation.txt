For the most part, the assignment was relatively easy to complete. I did however have issues with the second task.
I had problems with getting the buttons to be made dynamically with the eventlistener added to them. The issue I had
was incorrect synaxs for adding the event listener. After I had that issue fixed, the next issue I had was getting the
color correct. I needed to both store and pass the RGB values, but I needed them to be in Hex form. The issue I had was
if the value was less than 10, then the returned Hex value was only a single digit. This caused coloration problems. I
finally fixed it by using a simple If-Else to determine if the value was below 10. If it was, then add a 0 infront of
the value to ensure a 00-00-00 format, otherwise it can just return as itself. All in all, the second task gave me the
bigget problems and took me longer than I had wanted.
