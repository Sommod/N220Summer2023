The majority of these assignments were relaxing. The biggest set of code I needed help with was the setTimeout function.
I wanted to have the code 'wait' for a few seconds after each guess whether right or not. I needed to lookpup the code
to use to make the code wait and change the display div after the X seconds. The website I used for getting the code was
(https://timmousk.com/blog/javascript-wait-5-seconds/). This gave me enough information to use it how I wanted it. Once that
was done, I realized I was changing the 'display' Div tag a lot, so I decieded to remove all the getters of getElementById and
put it into a single function that would change the tag based on the parameter.
