This assignment was a little tricky in a few places. The first task was simple, so I decided
to do WAY more than I needed to. Rather than using simple If-Else statements to display the
String representation of the Food/Energy, I decided to make Enum Classes and use those for
determining the String value. The second assignment went without a hitch, just spent some extra
time ensuring the enlarging and shrinking animation was done correctly based on X/Y coordinates.
Finally, the third assignment took much longer than I had expected. The first problem I ran into
was getting the right formula for calculating a point on a circle. I needed to go online and help
determind the correct formula. Once that was done, the next issue I had was determining how to properly
display each circle with the correct change in X/Y coordinate to simulate what looked like circles going
in circles. I decided to just use simple If-Else statements for changing values, mainly because I got lazy
and because I was running out of time for the assignment.
