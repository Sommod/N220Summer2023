Most of the assignments were relatively simple enough to follow. I did have a few moments where
something didn't work or caused an issue. The second assignment I had a problem with selecting the
correct numberical value from the array. When getting a random number from 0 - 3, I accidentally was
setting the value to get a number from 1 - 4. This caused an OutOfBoundsExeption to be thrown as
there was not 5th element within the array. A simple removal of the (+1) I had in the formula fixed
the issue.
For the last assignment, the only problem I had was having the direction of the circle going in the
opposite direction; so instead of chasing the mouse, it was trying to run away.
