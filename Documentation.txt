For all the assignments, the code and creation was easy. I did have to lookup how
to clear an input tag as I had forgot how to do so. I used the website:
(https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_clear_input.asp) to help me. Once I saw
how to do it, I felt like an idiot and should have already known how to do so considering
I knew how to get the value. Another item I noticed after I had already sent the code to Github,
and am too lazy to change, for the first assignment, I could have just split the input directly
into the array object, but instead went through each element and added them separately. This code
was unncessary, but it still got the job done.
