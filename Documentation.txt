When completing this assignment, the main problem I had was understanding that the function "Draw"
is called continuouesly. With this, you can draw items and objects every frame by simply having
the methods/code within the method. As such I spent a longer time trying to figure out how to create
a loop that would get the current frame and alter the drawing myself. I had to reference the P5 information
about frameRate; both how it's working and how to set it.
